1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

My website will put all tracking information on one page for a user.  This page will update with the latest available tracking information and be able to send SMS or email as package progresses or when it is delivered.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?

Anyone wanting to have more up to date information on their tracking and to be able to see all of their packages in one place.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.

data plan and APIs are in outline file

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?

The APIs should be pretty straight forward.  Scaling could be an issue if any require payment, but as a test case, it should be fine.

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?

Photos from user's webcam would be considered sensitive, but I am trying to have them store that local.  Also the user might have to upload their phone number for the SMS functionality

d. What functionality will your app include?

User visits homepage of webstie to see all of their tracking info.  SMS messages will be sent if the user chooses to have that feature used

e. What will the user flow look like?

User uploads tracking number and the website should do the rest.  There will be a decent amount more setup if the user chooses to use the webcam feature.

f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?

I am trying to add webcam functionality where it can watch for packages on your front porch.
