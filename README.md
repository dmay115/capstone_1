App Title: Bartender
URL: https://bartendercapstone.onrender.com
This website lets the user generate and stock virtual bar based on ingredients they have on hand at home.  They can then select different ingredients to create a list of cocktails they can make that use those ingredients.
I have set up this website to help a user come up with some ideas for cocktails to make at home.  I have included the static ingredient list so they can return to the website and not have to start by just searching for ingreidnets. They will be able to select from their initial setup of their profile, unless they need to make changes to what they have on hand.  I also implimented a drink history so they can return to some cocktails they have enjoyed in the past. 
A user would start by creating a login.  They can then search through a list of ingredients to add to their "bar". After setting up their on hand ingreidents, the user can then select any number of ingreidents to search for drinks using those ingredients. This will generate a list of any drinks that use a combonation of the selected ingreidents.  If they find one they like, the can view the recipe and make the drink.  After making the drink, the website lets them make any notes about the cocktail they made and also give it a rating out of 5 stars.
